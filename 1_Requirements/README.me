## Introducion

Tic-Tac-Toe game is very popular and is fairly simple by itself. It is a computer based game for two players X and O. They take turns marking the spaces in the 3 x 3 grid with X and O alternatively. The player who succeeds in placing three successive marks either in horizontal, diagonal or vertical wins the game.

## RESEARCH

It is often used as a pedagogical tool for teaching the concepts of good sportsmanship and the branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the searching of game trees. It is straightforward to write a computer program to play tic-tac-toe perfectly or to enumerate the 765 essentially different positions (the state space complexity) or the 26,830 possible games up to rotations and reflections (the game tree complexity) on this space. If played optimally by both players, the game always ends in a draw, making tic-tac-toe a futile game.
